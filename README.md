Hello I made this Stomp Changer Script for Da hood Custom only works in Hood Mooded But the Custom Version I made this script for fun Its open sourced aswell I Will Update it in the Future But Currently i Dont care about this script becuase only thing it does it change the
Module script name How it works it u need equip your current stomp effect doesnt matter wich and it goes in ReplicatedStorage and in folder "KillFX" and changes the name of the Current stomp effect That you own To "uwu" and takes that name from the Current stomp and changes to
the stomp you wanted to Use Its really basic how it works Not hard to do i made it using Dex Explorer Dont need to code You can do it with Dex Explorer Aswell Have fun Skidding it! -- Ethan!
