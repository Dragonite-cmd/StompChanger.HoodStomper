Module script name How it works it u need equip your current stomp effect doesnt matter wich and it goes in ReplicatedStorage and in folder KillFX and changes the name of the Current stomp effect That you own To "uwu" and takes that name from the Current stomp and changes to
the stomp you wanted to Use Its really basic how it works Not hard to do i made it using Dex Explorer Dont need to code You can do it with Dex Explorer Aswell Have fun Skidding it! -- Ethan!
